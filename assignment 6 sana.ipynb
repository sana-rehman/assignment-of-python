    "Object-oriented programming (OOP) refers to a type of computer programming (software design) in which programmers define the data type of a data structure, and also the types of operations (functions) that can be applied to the data structure. Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming language model in which programs are organized around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic. An object can be defined as a data field that has unique attributes and behavior. Examples of an object can range from physical entities, such as a human being that is described by properties like name and address."

    "A function is a piece of code that is called by name. It can be passed data to operate on (i.e. the parameters) and can optionally return data (the return value). All data that is passed to a function is explicitly passed. A function is a group of reusable code which can be called anywhere in your program. This eliminates the need for writing the same code again and again. It helps programmers in writing modular codes. A method is a piece of code that is called by a name that is associated with an object. In most respects it is identical to a function except for two key differences: A method is implicitly passed the object on which it was called. A method is able to operate on data that is contained within the class (remembering that an object is an instance of a class - the class is the definition, the object is an instance of that data). Method and a function are the same, with different terms. A method is a procedure or function in object-oriented programming."
